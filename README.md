###*About Information*
Hello my friends!<br>
This is a very simple small project, so I don't upload it to 'jcenter' or 'Maven Center'.<br>
Please download it and deploy to your Android Studio.<br>
Using this demo, you will know how to achieve.<br>
And my english is very bad, so I can only write so many.<br>
Hope there is no syntax error?<br>
